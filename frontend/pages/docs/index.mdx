## What is hntr.sh?

hntr is a small but powerful tool to gather all information regarding targets.
Data is organized in **containers**, an each data point is called a **record**.

Each box is only identified with a UUID. Share this URL to work with others
collaboratively.

To make this really simple to integrate into your toolchain, every container
list can be filled (and exported from) over HTTP. Example commands for *curl*
in combination with other tools is given.

As soon as you have filled your first container, you can create an
**Automation**, which executes a *Job* for each record in your container. The
command which is executed should then return entries which are filled back into
a container of your choice (and with tags of your choice).

### A simple usecase for mapping a target infrastructure

Let's talk about an example usecase to show the capabilities of what you can
do.

First, fill your *hostnames* container with some (sub-)domains of your target.
After creating a box, choose the *Hostnames* container, click the *Import*
button and copy the given curl command to pipe some domains into your box. We
will also add a tag `root_scope` to this entries to mark them as our initial
root domains. This is done by adding a `tags` parameter.

```
cat domains.txt | curl --data-binary @- "http://localhost:8080/api/box/f7a08ee9-6d28-4b3a-8364-526f77578003/hostnames?tags=root_scope"
```

After we have added this data, we can switch over to the **Automations** tab to
create a simple workflow: For every record in our **Hostnames** container
matching the tag `root_scope`, execute [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)
and feed the resulting data back into the *Hostnames* container with a new tag
`source:amass`.

We can now select our imported automation and click on *Start Automation* to schedule
all records. A job runner will now take every single record and run it with amass.

If you are using our cloud service, you need to execute the job runner on your machine/server for yourself.
