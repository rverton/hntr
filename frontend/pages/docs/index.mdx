## What is hntr?

hntr is a small but powerful tool to gather all information regarding targets.
Data is organized in **containers**, an each data point is called a **record**.

Each box is only identified with a UUID. Share this URL to work with others
together:

`https://hntr.unlink.io/records/?id=[exampleId]`

To make this really simple to integrate into your toolchain, every container
can be filled (and exported from) over HTTP. 

`cat hostnames.txt | curl --data-binary @- "https://hntr.unlink.io/api/box/[exampleId]/hostnames"`

Use the interface to search by tags (`tag:foobar`) or part of the record
(`.foo.com`). You can select entries (hold the *Alt*-key while clicking) and
then execute actions on it. Further keyboard shortcuts are a work in progress.

### Automations

As soon as you have filled your first container with some data, you can create an
**Automation**, which executes a **Job** for each record in your container. The
command which is executed should then return entries which are filled back into
a container of your choice (and with tags of your choice).

Choose example automations from the <ExampleButton>Library</ExampleButton> button or add your own. As soon
as you have defined an automation and scheduled records for processing, you
need to run the worker script which will pull jobs from the backend, execute
them and return back results. Run as much workers as you want. Jobs are only
delivered once to a worker. You are able to parallelize your workloads this way
to multiple hosts.

## A simple usecase for mapping a target infrastructure

Let's talk about an example usecase to show the capabilities of what you can
do.

First, fill your <HighlightWord>Hostnames</HighlightWord> container with some
(sub-)domains of your target. After creating a box, choose the
<HighlightWord>Hostnames</HighlightWord> container, click the
<ExampleButton>Import</ExampleButton> button and copy the given curl command to
pipe some domains into your box. We will also add a tag `root_scope` to this
entries to mark them as our initial root domains. This is done by adding a
`tags` parameter.

`cat domains.txt | curl --data-binary @- "https://hntr.unlink.io/api/box/[exampleId]/hostnames?tags=root_scope"`

After we have added this data, we can switch over to the **Automations** tab to
create a simple workflow: For every record in our <HighlightWord>Hostnames</HighlightWord> container
matching the tag `root_scope`, execute [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)
and feed the resulting data back into the *Hostnames* container with a new tag
`source:amass`.

We can now select our imported automation and click on <ExampleButton>Start
Automation</ExampleButton> to schedule all records. A job runner will now take
every single record and run it with amass.

<InfoBox>
If you are using the cloud service, you need to execute the job runner on your machine/server for yourself.
