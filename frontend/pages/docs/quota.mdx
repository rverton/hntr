## Fair Use Quota

The maximum amount of records is limited to a specific quota you can see on the bottom left corner. This quota may change over time until I have a better overview of how people use boxes.

If a box is not accessed for a few months, it *may* be removed with all related data in the future. Please backup important data with the `Export` functionality.
